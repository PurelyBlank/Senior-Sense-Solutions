```

### Launch Local Instance

Create a PostgreSQL database with TimescaleDB extension according to the following information:

Username: postgres
Password: postgres
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Database name: testdb

In the backend directory, create a .env file with the following fields:

```
JWT_SECRET_KEY=s34pkq13/+sWTiW+VXNGq6JTznEh/6UTqG0k2sZ+kxs=
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres

```

In one terminal, navigate to the backend directory and execute:
