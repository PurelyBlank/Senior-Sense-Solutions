~ **_Project in providing elderly care through a wearable device_**

#### Motivation/Background
As the number of elderly in our population continues to grow, the increase in population also has a proportional demand in healthcare services as age related frequencies start to become more prominent. Some of these healthcare issues, including dementia - one of the most prevalent affiliations among the elderly population - is projected to rise to about 153 million by 2050, leading to cognitive impairment and compromising their autonomy. This can affect the cost of services of elderly care by requiring more caregivers to support the elderly. As a result, new and emerging technologies are needed to assist in monitoring these growing medical issues for the elderly population, and reducing the aforementioned unmet needs in the healthcare system.

#### Our Solution
The described problem can be addressed through the design and development of a wrist-worn device, similar to a watch with biometric monitoring capability. As part of a joint project effort with the UCI Biomedical Engineering (BME) team, ICS team will be responsible for the software functionality of the wrist device as well as a web application to accompany it.

A wearable device will feature a user interface that displays the time and battery level. It will also be capable of receiving reminders, notifications, and alerts, with the ability to create reminders as well. Additionally, the wearable will offer fall detection, GPS tracking, and vital monitoring, including heart rate.

A website will be designed to store and analyze the patient’s data from the wearable, including activity levels, heart rate trends. It will also monitor medication compliance trends and falling incidents, sending alerts to caregivers when necessary. The app will display the device's battery level and location.

The web application consists of internal links that lead to multiple pages, each deriving their data from the wrist device and displaying them with a user-centric format in real-time. Each of these webpages are described as follows:

   * Login: Enables user authentication functionality with a simple, intuitive interface consisting of text fields that prompt the user to enter their credentials. A successful login attempt redirects the user to the homepage, while an unsuccessful attempt deletes the contents of the text field, displays an error for an incorrect username, password, or both, and prompts the user to re-enter their credentials. Any attempt to navigate to the other pages without logging in will be automatically redirected to the login page.
   * Home (Biometric Monitoring Page): The main landing page after a successful login attempt by the user, which displays the most vital aspects of visualized data. Additionally, it displays unread and/or unresolved alerts and notifications that can each be expanded to view additional information, and contains an internal link to their corresponding pages. Will be designed to store and analyze the patient’s data, including activity levels, heart rate trends
   * Battery Tracker: Derives data relating to remaining battery life from the wrist device, and visualizes them on the page.
   * Location: Derives data relating to location from the wrist device, and visualizes it on Google Map.
